		<h2>HTML - The Foundation of the Web</h2>

				<strong>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</strong> is the most basic building block of the Web.
				It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally
				used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript)
			</p>

			<p>
				"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or
				between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and
				linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.
			</p>

		<h3>What is HTML</h3>

			<p>
				HTML stands for HyperTextMarkup Language. It is a markup language that defines the structure of your content.
				HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to
				make it appear a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can
				italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.
			</p>

			<p>
				HTML consist of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc.
				Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.
			</p>

			<p>
				The Main Parts of Elements are as Follows
			</p>

				<ol>
					<li>The opening tag</li>
					<li>The closing tag</li>
					<li>The content</li>
					<li>The element</li>
				</ol>
